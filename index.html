                <ol>
                    <li>The main one is the photography ! I usually take some pictures with my camera and I'm the official photograph of my karate club.</li>
                    <li>The second is the magie. I practice it since my 10 year old with a teacher but I don't remember when I really begun to like it and practice.</li>
                    <li>The last one is the Kpop. The full name is KoreanPop and it's a style of music that I like a lot. Maybe you heared about BTS, one of the most known group.</li>
